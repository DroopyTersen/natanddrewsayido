        <h1>Travel</h1>
        <p>The two ways best ways to get here would probably be to fly into Boise... OR make a roadtrip out of it!</p>
        <h2>Fly</h2>
        <p>You can fly into Boise International Airport. From there Ketchum is about 2.5 hours. We looked recently and found rental cars for about $30/day.</p>
        <h2>Roadtrip</h2>
        <p>If you are driving from WI you will see some incredible sights like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Badlands National Park</li>
            <li>Mount Rushmore</li>
            <li>Yellowstone National Park</li>
            <li>Grand Tetons National Park</li>
        </ul>
