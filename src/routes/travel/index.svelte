    <h2>Fly</h2>
    <p>
      You can fly into Boise International Airport. From there, Ketchum is a 2.5
      hour drive (3 hours if you take the scenic way, but it is worth it). We
      looked recently and found rental cars for about $30/day.

    <h2>Roadtrip</h2>
    <p>
      If you drive to Idaho from Wisconsin you will see some incredible sights:
    </p>
