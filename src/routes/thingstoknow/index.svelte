          We'll be having a social hour starting at 4pm if you want to come
          early.

      <b>The Venue</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Don't count on cell coverage at the venue. You should easily get a
          signal in Ketchum though.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <a href="/accomodations#cabins">guest cabins</a> have electricity and
          lights but no heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a "bathroom building" in the middle of the camp. It's nothing
          fancy, but it's indoor plumbing with toilets and showers.
          Unfortunately, there aren't bathrooms in the guest cabins or lodge.

        <li>
          Because of the elevation it will probably be colder than you'd think
          for June. Expect upper 60's during the day and upper 30's at night.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enough of that negative stuff. We'll all be fine and the area is
          gorgeous. You are welcome to arrive early and hang out at the camp any
          time between Friday noon and Sunday 9am.
